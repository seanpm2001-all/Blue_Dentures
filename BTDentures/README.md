# BlueTooth Dentures/BTDentures - This is root

You are currently at the root (base/bottom) of the programming for the BlueTooth dentures program. For non-programmers, you should go to the install page, which is outside of this folder. This folder may be too technical for you.

[Install page](/README.md)

For programmers, you should access all directories inside of here, and modify the ones you feel you can improve. For anyone who can program efficiently in machine code (Assembly) I tip my hat to you. You are likely very experienced, and you can help a lot with this project with your expertise.

This project is currently in very early Alpha and is a concept release, so it is not functional yet.
